# Character shuffler

Toy project to learn more about Python (2.7.11). Takes a text file as commandline argument and shuffles the letters in the words. That means that this: 

> Lnog wdors is waht we stirve for atoluhgh sohrt wdros are also good tsets

could be the result of shuffling this line:

> Long words is what we strive for although short words are also good tests

## Installation

No installation needed. Only python 2.7(.11) required. This means that running `python --version` on a commandline should return that python version.

## Usage

After cloning the project and `cd`ing into the project folder, simply run the program with the example textfile `python shuffler.py test.txt`.

You should also be able to run the tests from the commandline by running `python test_shuffler.py -v`

## License

Do whatever you want with the code on your own risk.
